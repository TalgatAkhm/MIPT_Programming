A little about my codestyle:
	using spaces to emphasis operators;
	using the braces placement is on the next line;
	using the snake-case style for variables, functions, classes and structures;
	using upper-case style for constants;
	using structs only for not complicated objects;
	using public-protected-private ordering in class;
	using input/output streams only in main() function;
